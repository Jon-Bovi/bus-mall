User Stories (MVP):

As a marketing researcher, I want to be able to track the focus group's clicks to identify which images are being chosen while displaying 3 random pictures 25 times.

As the developer, I am going to code an app that randomly runs 3 images from a bundle of images so that the user can click on one of the three images. Will also need a tracker to keep a tally on how many times each image is clicked on. The UX/UI will need to be clean and simple so that the user does not become distracted while running.

As the focus group participant, I am going to see three images and will need to pick one. This marketing test will run 25 times. In theory, I will click 25 times from a series of images.
